# üìÖ 30 Days React Challenge

I‚Äôve started this **30 Days React Challenge** to **strengthen my knowledge of React** and build a solid foundation with hands-on projects.
The goal is to **learn, practice, and apply** React concepts daily ‚Äî and post all progress here on GitHub for accountability.

---

## üéØ **Why I‚Äôm Doing This**

* To master React fundamentals, hooks, routing, and state management
* To improve my problem-solving skills by building real projects
* To create a portfolio of React projects that I can showcase
* To stay consistent with daily learning and coding

---

## üìå **How This Works**

* Each day = **One React topic + One mini task**
* Every week = **One mini project**
* End of challenge = **A complete full-stack React project deployed online**
